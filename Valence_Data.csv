Why is it always so hard... and hurts so bad...,1
Life is one big mess to me. When will I ever learn how to figure it out.,1
"Everybody hates me now, so fuck it,	I'm not afraid to cry, but that's none of your business!	Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it?	Spin it around so I can spit in it's face.	I wanna leave without a trace,	'Cause I don't wanna die in this place!",1
Never realised someone could be so self centred! I couldn't live with my self if I had to lie to myself to get to sleep at night. Yes I've Hurt people before but at least when I learn to admit i was wrong I don't expect to be imeadiatly forgiven        .. God damn it,1
"y does every1 i like soo much breaks my heart? little by little i break down, i cant stop my emotions, i cant understand it either...im losing it..idk wut to do w/ my life..i thought i knew but now i dont noe..",1
fuck fuck fuck,1
"stayin onto somthn,always -i m talkin about that indefinite numb u experience when u stare into space thinkng about stuff u wished u do, u did'nt & u did which gave no returns but past time for nothin.",1
i think this last week has really changed my perspective on a few things....i will never go to sleep angry ever again....and will always say i love you b4 every departure...i tried being angry at my brother and hung up the phone on him and he died that ni,1
And use my blood as lubricant to rape my lifeless body,1
At least 15 dead as israeli forces attack Gaza aid ahips!!!!!!! i hhhhhhate israil,1
"well, we're in the hospital. my poor baby has had two spinal taps. we still dont know whats wrong....",1
Ive finally realized that my babies (monster)mom is someone I don't even want to be around she has become a stranger to me I'm beginning to hate her,1
"good night, i hate you all, especially you.",1
severe anger,1
"JUST GOT LAID OFF AND NEED TO FIND SOME WORK, WHAT A NEW YEAR",1
homework SUX!!!! WHY DO TEACHERS TOURCHER US THIS WAY?!?!?!?!?!?!,1

The sweet asphyxiation and dismemberment. Sex puts me in the mood to make you die. Obsessive hands gently grab your neck. Look into sick eyes... I hate people,1

Rest in peace nick. Things won't be the same anymore when I go back to manila without u there. Goodbye friend.,1
this is your life and its ending one minute at a time.,1

Every seems like a pointless repetitive cycle that never ends but it must go on. I just want something to happen to make it seem like there's a point to it all.,1
"My heart is broken for my sister. Her husband died today. She is a total mess, but I will help her get through this. I am strong enough. Maybe if I tell myself that enough, it will come true.",1
Poor Abraham Lincoln its to bad you an Barack Obama can't trade places. Anti Obama I hate that guy. F_ _ _ you Obama your biggest fan RFM.,1
